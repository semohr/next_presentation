# Custom components

Infinite possibilities using custom components!

You can then import them in your slides markdown file and use them like any other jsx component.

## Example

Slide.mdx:

```mdx
import { MyComponent } from "../components/MyComponent";

<MyComponent />
```

<SlideControl />

<Navbar />
