Telegram manages sending messages via chats here they differentiate between four types of
chats.

-   Private Chats
    -   One to one chats e.g. between you and your friend
-   Group Chats
    -   Chats with multiple people e.g. a group chat with your friends
-   Channel Chats
    -   Chats with multiple people where only the creator can post messages e.g. a channel for your
        company
    -   public by default
-   Super Group Chats
    -   Chats with multiple people where everyone can post messages e.g. a group chat for your
        institute
    -   public by default

<Note>
    I show you all types here such that it is clear that there are always some
    limitations as one can not join a non-public channel or super group chat.
