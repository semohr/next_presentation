<Note>
    For instance by using dual use technologies, i.e. technologies that can be used for good and bad. Here I took this very recent paper "Can large language models democratize access to dual-use biotechnology?". Here 10 non scientests got tasks with creating a pandemic with the help of a llm. The chatbot was able to suggest four potential pandemic pathogens and explained how they can be generated from synthetic DNA, supplied names of companies unliekly to screen orders.

    These results suggest that event people with little to no laboratory training can use llm to create widle destructive substances. So we might have to think about how we can prevent this from happening or if we are fine with the risk of things like this happening.

    As of now there is no precendent for this kind of usage but for me it is compelling that some people are already thinking about this. The point of entry is lowered significantly, and it most likely will only get easier for malicious actors. As this paper shows, you dont have to study biochemistry to create a pandemic pathogen.

    The same applies for lots of other fields thinking about bombs, radiation, chemicals and warfare...

    On the other side, you might argue that we should allow for as much open knowledge as possible as it advances society. But we also have to keep in mind that this comes with alot of responsibility and normally rigerous education and training.

    And the biggest problem is, that even we as researchers and engineer that create these models don't even know of the full capabilities of these models. Nearly every day there is a new article on things that llm can do. Chemisty, Math, Music, order a pizza and so on.

    We dont know what is in the models.
