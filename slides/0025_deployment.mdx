<Note>
    Current deployment is mainly done by industry, I always thought that open source has a bit bigger stake in 
    all of this but I could not find any source to support that. Since 2017, all the biggest models are coming from
    industry. 
    This is kinda expected as the increasing amount of compute needed to train these models is normally not available
    to the average researcher. Additionally approx. 75% of all PhDs in AI reasearch are hired by industry.

    Thus the current deployment is mainly done by industry. These enteties are just rushing to get infront of the
    field and they try to get results fast as they want to get the dominance in the field. E.g. google spend 1.5 billion USD
    on DeepMind in 2019, to put this into perspective that is 18 USD per person in Germany.

    Sadly this also leads to a lot of ethical issues as they care less about the implications of their work and
    more about the results as we have seen in the examples. Premature deployment of models is the norm and not the exception.
