## My opinion

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', gap: "4rem", width:"80%",
    alignItems: "center", margin: "auto", marginTop: "2rem", marginBottom: "2rem"}}>

<div
    style={{
        position: 'relative',
        flex: 1,
        marginRight: '1rem'
    }}
>
    <img src="octo.png" style={{ width: '100%' }} />
    <div
        style={{
            position: 'absolute',
            top: '50%',
            left: 'calc(50% - 2.5rem)',
            fontSize: '10rem',
        }}
    >?</div>
</div>
<div

    To get to an end and give you my opinion.
    I dont think we are at the stage of full entanglement with society yet. At least compared
    the the social media curation AI. But we are getting there in due time if we do not change our
    employment behaviour drastically.

    We already see some dangers lurking around the corner similar to the curation AI ones. But we
    are also pretty early in the development of these technologies. There is most likely only more to come.

    Maybe we need some form of restrictions or more regulation regarding the deployment of these
    technologies. Especially if we think about tech/ai illiterate people or children in general.

    But as with all regulations we need to find the right tradeoff between openness, accessibility,
    and on the other hand security. Thinking about FAIR principles. Maybe only regulating commercial
    products could be a decent tradeoff.

    Dont get me wrong even tho I showed mostly the negative aspects I'm still excited to see the
    next advances in the field and the advantages these bring. Also im working and reasearching in
    this field. But in the same breath im also worried about the about our current deployment
    strategies.

    I would love to hear your take on all of this. Let's start into the discussion, if you have
    some questions or annotations feel free to ask or go ahead now. I prefer if you just speak up
    but if you are more comfortable with writing it down feel free to do so.
