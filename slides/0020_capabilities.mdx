<Note>
    Not only do we not know the capabilites of these models, as of now we are also not able to predict the capabilites
    of future models.

    Here we can see benchmarks of different models in four different tasks. We can see the size of the models in parameters on the x axis and the performance on the y axis. The capabilites of language models are just appearing at a specific model size.

    We see that at a specific size the capabilites or performance of these models just appear. For instance in A the task is to perform some arithmetic. The models are not able to perform the task at all if they are too small and than at some point they just know how to do it.

    Thus it is really difficult to know what is inisde these models even for the researchers and scientists.
