    Let's recap what we have seen so far in these examples.

    I didn't go too much into it, but of course this technology has alot of advantages such as, boosting productivity, allowing easier and more creative expression, of course helps in automation, e.g. code generation and is usefull as a reasearch tool.

    But in the examples we have seen the dangers creeping around the corner. The previous weeks, we have talked about bias and also discussed ai rights but we can also see the dangers of impersonation via deep fakes and the dangers of missuse of this technology.

    I always try to disect such problems and try to find the root cause of the problem. For more the root cause, boils our deployment strategy.
