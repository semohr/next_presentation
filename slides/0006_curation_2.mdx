    But it is no only the risk from artifical general intelligence that the scientific community is concerned about. And this might also not be the reason most researchers are concerned at the moment.

    In my research I identified two major groups of A.I. system that interacted with humans or are used by humans most.

    First of there is the type of curation based AI. The propose of this technology or system is to select and filter information. This is and can be done for a variet of tasks. Take for instance google, news aggregation, shopping recommendations, dating apps, or social media feeds. The chances are good that everything you see on your phone is curated by an AI system at some point.

    Alot of advantages come with these systems, such as the ability to find information faster. Highly personalized recommendations this also allows smaller companies to be found by customers. Especially with our increasingly growing rate
    of data creation and the amount of information that is available to us. It is nearly impossible to find the information we are looking for without the help of these systems.

    Early on as the impact of these systems was not understood yet, the focus was on the advantages of these systems. But as time went on and the dangers of these systems became more and more apparent. We quickly realized that optimizing for our attention comes e.g. with addiction problems. Additionally, it is very easy to consume missinformation as these systems issolate similar minded people and thus leads to a conformation bias. Somtimes also called filter bubble or echo chamber. This is also the reason why these systems can be used to radicalize people, take for example the al-Qaeda recruitment on facebook (not sure if you remember this, but it was around 2011).
    And lastly these systems are also used to censor information thinking about the great firewall of china.

    You might now ask yourself if this is such a big problem why dont we just regulate it. Well, the problem is that these systems are so entangled with our society that it is nearly impossible to regulate them. Think about politics, the economy and even our personal lives nothing of these are untouched by this. Thus it is not surprising that it is nearly impossible to regulate and control this technology.

    Keep in mind that we did not know about all these problems when we started to use these systems. And it is not the fault of the people who created these systems. It is just that we did not know about the dangers of these systems and just deployed them without thinking doing studies. And now we are sadly mainly stuck with it.

    This is all a bit of a retrospective as these problems started and are studied since the early 2000s. As of now we are still trying to figure out how to deal with these problems.
