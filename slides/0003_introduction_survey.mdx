    What probability do you put on human inability to control future advanced
    AI systems causing human extinction or similarly permanent and severe
    disempowerment of the human species?

<Note>
    50% of A.I. researchers think there is a **10%** or greate chance that humans go extinct due to the inability to control A.I. This was suprising to me.

    This was from a survey of ~740 A.I. researchers in Aug. 2022. Let me repeat that: 50% of A.I. researchers think there is a 10% or greater chance that humans go extinct due to the inability to control A.I.

    This is the same as if you were to board a plane and 50% of the engeniers who built the plane say there is a 10% chance the plane would crash and kill everyone on board.
    Would you get on this plane? For AI it is worse because you can decide not to board a plane, but we as AI reasearchers or big companies that
    are just boarding everyone at the moment.
