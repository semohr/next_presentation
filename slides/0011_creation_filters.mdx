    Let's have a look at this first. [play]

    Well, sound and looks good, right? Can be fun and is good for selfconcious people.

    The big problem with is the implications, we dont know if a person we see digitally is
    real or not.
    Now imagine tiktok deploying a trump and binden filter or for germans here
    Björn Höcke and Scholz filter. This has the potential to complety break the
    society into incoherence and chaos. This could increase polarization
    and make it impossible to have a discussion with people. It would be
    impossible to know what the politicians really said and what not.

    The worst about this, none of this would be illegal as of now there is no real law against
    that. For the company there is no responsibility without strict laws.

    We also dont even know if the person we talk to is real, voice cloning has also gotten
    alot better [next]
