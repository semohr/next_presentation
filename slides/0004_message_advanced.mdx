-   Attached to messages
-   Similar to threads in a forum
-   Used in channels, where you can't post messages
-   The UI calls them "discussions"

<Note>
    A typical message in a channel might look like here on the right.

    - You have some basic text
    - And telegram also allows for special Entities e.g. links to other websites, emojis, markup or mentions and so on.
